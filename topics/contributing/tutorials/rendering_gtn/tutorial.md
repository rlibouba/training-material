If you are working on training materials, you will likely want to preview your changes as you go! You have a few options on how to do this.

{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html option1="Codespaces" option2="Gitpod" option3="Command-line" default="Codespaces"
       text="We recommend using Codespaces. We used to use Gitpod, however it loads a bit slower and the interface changed as of spring 2025, so the tutorial may be out of date. **CodeSpaces and GitPod are both online methods**; only the command-line option requires you to install things on your machine." %}

<div class="Codespaces" markdown="1">

If you are working on your own training materials and want preview them online without installing anything on your computer, you can do this using GitHub CodeSpaces! Everybody gets 60 free hours of CodeSpaces per month.



# Launching CodeSpaces

>    {% snippet topics/contributing/faqs/github-fork-master-main.md %}
>
>    {% snippet topics/contributing/faqs/github-fork-sync.md %}
>
> 2. **Navigate to your fork** of the GTN
>
> 3. Click on the green **Code** button
>
> 4. At the top, switch to the **CodeSpaces** tab
>    ![the codespaces tab of the menu](images/codespaces-launch.png)
>
> 5. Click on **Create codespace on main**
>    - Note: if you switch to a specific branch in GitHub first, you can create a codespace for that branch
>
> 6. This will setup a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) environment for you
>    - It may take a couple minutes to finish setting everything up
>    - In this environment you can also build the GTN website to preview your changes
>    - When everything is ready, you should see something like this:

{: .hands_on}

# The VScode environment

Let's have a closer look at your CodeSpaces window:

- **Left:** Here you see all the files in the GTN repository
- **Top:** This is the main window where you can view and edit files
- **Bottom:** Terminal window. Here you can type commands (e.g. to build the website preview) and read output and error messages.

![VScode interface](images/codespaces-home.png)


# Build and preview the GTN website

Before we start making any changes, let's build the website and get a live preview.

> <hands-on-title>Setting up GitPod</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. In the terminal window (bottom), type the following command:
>    `make preview`
>
>    - This will take 2-3 minutes to complete
>
>    ![output in the terminal after issuing the make preview command](images/codespaces-make-preview.png)
>
> 3. When the build process is finished, a preview window will automatically open (at the top right)
>    - The preview will show the GTN 404 (codespace doesnt know what to show)
>    - Just click on **Return to homepage**.
>
>    > <tip-title>Window not opening? </tip-title>
>    > If the preview window doesn't open for you, or if you close it and want to reopen it, you can always do so as follows:
>    > 1. Go to the **Ports** tab of the bottom panel
>    >
>    >    ![screenshot of the tabs on the bottom panel](images/codespaces-ports-tab.png)
>    >
>    > 2. Hover over the link in the **Forwarded Address** column, 3 icons should appear
>    >
>    >    ![screenshot of the 3 icons](images/codespaces-ports-preview-buttons.png)
>    >
>    > 3. Click on:
>    >    - The **world/globe icon** to open the GTN preview in a new window, or
>    >    - Or, click on the **window icon** to the right of the globe icon to preview the GTN in a tab inside the codespaces environment
>    {: .tip}
>
> 4. If you opened the GTN preview inside the codespace, your window will now look something like this:
>
>    ![screenshot of the codespace with the preview editor opend to the GTN homepage](images/codespaces-preview-editor.png)
>
>    > <tip-title>Not opening?</tip-title>
>    > ![screenshot of firefox permissions dialog which shows blocked windows and an allow menu](../../images/gitpod_popup.png)
>    > Some browsers block popups by default, you may need to allow CodeSpaces to show popups in your browser.

>
{: .hands_on}



# Editing Training Materials on CodeSpaces

Now that you have the codespace environment working and we have a live preview up, let's make some changes to the GTN materials and get an instant preview.


**Scenario:** You have spotted a typo in one of the tutorials, and would like to fix this and see the resulting GTN webpage.


> <hands-on-title>Make and view changes</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. In the preview of the GTN website, open the following tutorial:
>    - Topic: "Introduction to Galaxy Analyses" topic
>    - Tutorial: "A Short Introduction to Galaxy""
>    - We will edit this tutorial and watch the live preview window for the effects
>
>
> 2. On the file browser on the left, open the following file:
>
>    ```
>    topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.md
>    ```
>
> 3. Change the title of the tutorial
>    - **From:** "A Short Introduction to Galaxy"
>    - **To:** "A Short and Cool Introduction to Galaxy"
>
>    ![we changed the title of the tutorial in the text editor window](images/codespaces-tutorial-edited.png)
>
> 4. Save the file
>    - **CTRL+S** to save the file
>    - You should immediately see a message in the terminal saying "regenerating". CodeSpaces has detected your changes and is rebuilding the website.
>
>    ![the terminal shows a message stating the website is being regenerated](images/codespaces-regenerating.png)
>
> 5. Move to the top right panel where the GTN is previewed and refresh the website
>    - {% icon galaxy-refresh %} Refresh button in front of the address bar of the preview panel
>    - You can also open the preview in it's own brower tab, using the {% icon galaxy_instance %} button at the top-right corner of the preview window. Then you can reload the page the regular way (e.g. <kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl + r</kbd> or the reload button in the browser)
>
>    > <tip-title> Reload not working? </tip-title>
>    > It is possible that this reload button gives you the 404 again, in that case there are 2 solutions
>    > 1. Right-click in the preview panel, and choose
>    >    - Chrome: "Reload Frame"
>    >    - Firefox: "This Frame -> Reload Frame"
>    > 2. Open the preview in it's own browser tab
>    >    - Click the {% icon galaxy_instance %} button at the top-right corner of the preview window
>    {: .tip}
>
> 6. You should see the change you made:
>
>    ![The updated preview with our changed tutorial title](images/codespaces-reloaded.png)
>
{: .hands_on}


In this way you can edit files in the text editor, and see the effects in the website preview.


# Saving your changes back to GitHub

When you have finished your changes, it all looks good in the preview, you want to save your changes back to GitHub so that you can either continue later, or make a Pull Request to the GTN to contribute your changes.


> <hands-on-title>Comitting changes</hands-on-title>
> Before you can commit your changes you have to create a branch. You have two options to preform this task:
>  1. **Option 1: via the terminal**
>     - Hit <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd> if your preview was still running to stop it
>     - Create a new branch, commit your changes, push changes:
>
>     ```bash
>     git checkout -b fix-title
>     git commit -m "update tutorial title" topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.md
>     git push origin fix-title
>     ```
>
> 2. **Option 2: via the web interface**
>    - Create a new branch:
>      -  On the bottom-left, click on the branch logo (probably labelled "main")
>         ![button on the bottom of the page with the current branch](images/codespaces-branch-change1.png)
>      - Enter `fix-title` as the name for your new branch (at top of window)
>         ![Addint a new branch](images/codespaces-branch-change2.png)
>      - Choose "+ Create new branch..." from the dropdown
>    - Commit changes:
>      - On the left menu, click on the "changed files" tab
>        ![button on the left menu to show changed files](images/codespaces-commit-1.png)
>      - You should see your changed file (`tutorial.md`)
>      - Click on the "+" icon next to the file we edited to *stage changes*
>        ![stage changes button](images/codespaces-commit-plus.png)
>      - Enter a commit message (top of window)
>      - Hit the checkmark icon below the massage to commit the changes
>   - Publish changes
>     - Click the cloud button at bottom left to publish your changes
>       ![publish changes button](images/codespace-publlish.png)
>
{: .hands_on}

Next, we will see these changes to on your branch/fork. We will do this from outside of our codespace.

> <hands-on-title>Pushing changes to GitHub</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. In your browser (outside of codespaces), navigate to the [GTN GitHub page](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material)
> 2. GitHub will helpfully show you any recent branches you've pushed to your fork
>    - Click the **Compare & pull request** button to create a PR for your changes
>    ![compare and pull request button on the new branch](images/codespaces-compare-pr.png)
{: .hands_on}


# Closing your CodeSpace

Everybody gets 60 hours per month for free on CodeSpaces. Your codespace will automatically shut down after 30 minutes of inactivity,
but it is always a good idea to close your CodeSpace when you are finished with it, to conserve your quotum.


> <hands-on-title>Shutting down your CodeSpace</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Return to the [GTN GitHub page](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material)
>
> 2. Click on the green **Code** button again
>
> 3. Under the Codespaces tab, you should see your running codespace
>
>    ![codespaces menu in github](images/codespaces-stop-1.png)
>
> 4. Click on the 3-dots menu to the right of your (randomly generated) codespace name
>
> 5. In this menu you can quit your codespace in two ways:
>    - **Stop codespace**: your changes will be kept and you can restart the codespace later
>    - **Delete** your codespace. Any changes you did not commit and push to GitHub are lost.
>      ![screenshot of the codespace options menu](images/codespaces-stop-2.png)
>
>    - In this menu you can also resume a stopped codespace by simply clicking **Open in Browswer**

# The GitPod Workspace

Let's have a closer look at the GitPod workspace:

- **Left:** Here you see all the files in the GTN repository
- **Top:** This is the main window where you can view and edit files
- **Bottom:** Terminal window. Here you can type commands (e.g. to build the website preview) and read output and error messages.

![GitPod welcome screen](../../images/gitpod/welcomepage.png)



# Build and preview the GTN website

Before we start making any changes, let's build the website and get a live preview.

>    `make serve-gitpod`
>
>    ![output in the terminal after issuing the make serve-gitpod command](../../images/gitpod/command.png)
>
> 2. The first time you run this command, it will install some dependencies, so it may take a little bit of time (a few minutes)
>    - Next times will be a lot faster! (~30 seconds)
>
> 3. When the build process is finished, the terminal will show you a link, and a window should popup with a preview on the right.

# Closing your GitPod Workspace

Everybody gets 50 hours per month for free on GitPod, so it is wise to close your GitPod workspace when you are finished with it, to conserve your quotum.

> <hands-on-title>Shutting down your GitPod workspace</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Click on the menu button at the top left corner of the screen
>    - Choose "Gitpod: Stop Workspace"

</div>

<div class="Command-line" markdown="1">

If you want to run the entire GTN material website locally or test your new training material you can do this!

Currently, the website is generated from the metadata and the tutorials using Jekyll, a simple static site builder.
We can use Jekyll to run a server to check if the tutorial is correctly added and rendered.


# Installation of the requirements

The first step is to install the needed tools inside a conda environment. A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of packages. For example here to run the website, we need ruby, pandas, requests, etc. By creating a conda environment and installing the needed tools there, we do not affect your main installation.

This step has to be done once.

We also need to make sure that a couple of other utilities and build requirements are present: **git**, **curl** & **make**. The easiest way to install these is with your package manager of choice - i.e. yum, apt, brew etc.

> <hands-on-title>Install the requirements</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Open a Terminal
> 2. Use your package manager to install `git`, `curl` and `make`
>
>    - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git curl make`
>    - For Fedora/CentOs/RedHat: `sudo yum install git curl make`
>
> 3. Clone the training material GitHub repository:
>    - `git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material.git`
>    - Note: The GTN repo is quite large, therefore we recommend to use the `--depth 1 --branch main` flags here. This will clone only the main branch, and only the most recent revision, rather than the full history.
> 4. Navigate to the the cloned repository
>    - `cd training-material`
> 5. Set up the conda environment (see tip box below for an method without conda)
>
>     It will install some needed tools (ruby, nodejs, etc) in a protected environment, without interfering with the existing tools or versions.

> <tip-title>[Advanced] Building GTN without Conda (using Ruby's RVM)</tip-title>
>
> If you do not want to use conda, you can also run jekyll directly using Ruby and RVM:
> 1. Install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) on your system ([instructions](https://rvm.io/rvm/install))
>    - For Ubuntu:
>      ```
>      sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
>      sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm
>      sudo apt-get update
>      sudo apt-get install rvm
>      sudo usermod -a -G rvm $USER
>      ```
> 2. Install a Ruby version
>    ```
>    rvm install ruby-3.2.4
>    ```
> 3. Create ruby GTN environment
>    ```
>    rvm use 3.2.4@gtn --create
>    ```
> 4. Install dependencies
>    ```
>    bundle install
>    ```
> 5. Run the GTN
>    - Always make sure your ruby environment is activated `rvm use 3.2.4@gtn` and up-to-date `bundle install`
>    - Get a GTN preview
>      ```
>      bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
>      ```
>    - Quicker build preview (but certain features are disabled)
>      ```
>      bundle exec jekyll serve --strict_front_matter -d _site/training-material --incremental --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml
>      ```
> 6. Changes now showing?
>    - Stop the preview, run `make clean`, `bundle install`, and rebuild it

# Checking the website generation

Once Jekyll and its modules are installed in our conda environment, we can check the generation of the website locally:

> <hands-on-title>Checking the website generation locally</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Run a local Jekyll server with `make serve-quick`
> 2. Visualize at [http://localhost:4000/training-material/ ](http://localhost:4000/training-material/)
> 3. Edit one of the tutorials:
>    - For example, open `topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-peaks2genes/tutorial.md` in a text editor of your choice.
>    - Make some changes to the *Introduction* paragraph, and save the file.
>    - Refresh the tutorial page in your browser until you can see the changes you made.
>        - this may take a little bit of time; in the terminal you can monitor when the regeneration is complete
>
{: .hands_on}

With `make serve-quick`, a local Jekyll server will run in background. It will check the changes and regenerate the website accordingly. You may need to reload the page to see the changes (and sometimes to wait 1-2 minutes).


> <tip-title>make serve vs make serve-quick</tip-title>
>
> 1. Use `make serve` instead of `make serve-quick` to get all plugins, but also configure the post, host and pass additional flags. This however can be quite slow.
>
> 2. Need to speed up the cloning step? You coud fetch only the latest commit of the main branch:
>
>    ```
>    $ git clone {{ site.github_repository }}.git --depth 1 --branch main
>    ```
>
> 3. Running on a VM or remote machine?
>
>    If you are not running this on your local machine, but e.g. on a VM, you may need to configure a webserver to serve the website.
>
>    Below is an example NGINX configuration (e.g. in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`)
>
>    ```
>    location /training-material/ {
>      root /home/ubuntu/training-material/_site/;
>    }
>    ```
>
>    Change the `root` path above to wherever you cloned the training material folder

# Stopping the server

Once you are done, you can stop the server and clean your repository.

> <hands-on-title>Stopping the server</hands-on-title>

> 1. Stop the server with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>
> 2. Clean the repository: `make clean`
