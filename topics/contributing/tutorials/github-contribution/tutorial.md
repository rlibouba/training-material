Most of the GTN content is written in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with some metadata (or variables) found in [YAML](http://yaml.org/) files. Everything is stored on a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository: [{{ site.github_repository }}]({{ site.github_repository }}).

The process of development of new content is open and transparent, using git and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), which we will walk you through:

![Open source development process](../../images/oss_development_process.png "Open source development process")

1. Create a fork
1. Clone your fork of this repository to create a local copy on your computer
1. Create a new branch in your local copy for each significant change
2. Commit the changes in that branch
1. Push that branch to your fork on GitHub
1. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [original repository]({{ site.github_repository }})
1. If you receive feedback, make changes in your local clone and push them to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically
1. Pull requests will be merged by the training team members after at least one other person has reviewed the Pull request and approved it.

A fork is a copy of a repository. [Forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project:

# Clone the GitHub repository on your computer

To modify the content of the repository, you need a copy of it on your computer. This step of importing a git repository is called "cloning":

# Create a new branch

You have now your repository locally and you want to modify it. For this example tutorial, you will add yourself as contributor of the project to appear on the [Hall of Fame]({% link hall-of-fame.md %}).

In GitHub flow, there is a concept: one new feature or change = one branch.

When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“ some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow. You should develop different features on different branches to help keep the changes you make simple and easy to review.

![Divergence of a branch compared to main](../../images/PR_branches_01.png "When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the main branch")

Here for this tutorial, you will create a branch called "my_new_branch" in which you will modify the `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` file, the file used to generate the [Hall of Fame]({% link hall-of-fame.md %}).

<div class="Desktop" markdown="1">

> <hands-on-title>Create a branch</hands-on-title>

> 1. Go to *Current Branch*

This branch is added to your local copy:

# Make your changes on this branch

You have created your first branch! Now you want to make the change in the `CONTRIBUTING.yaml` file. By changing a file in this branch, it will diverge from the `main` branch. It will contain data that is only on this new branch:

![Divergence of the branch compared to main](../../images/PR_branches_02.png "The changes on your branch will not be on the main branch")

# Push your branch on your GitHub repository

The changes you made on your branch are only on the local copy of the repository. To propagate them online, you need to push them on your fork on GitHub:

<div class="Desktop" markdown="1">
> <hands-on-title>Push the changes</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Select **Publish branch**
>       ![Publish branch](../../images/desktop-publish_branch.png)
>
{: .hands_on}

</div>


<div class="Command-line" markdown="1">

> <hands-on-title>Push the changes</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Push the changes to the GitHub repository
>
>    ```
>    $ git push origin my_new_branch
>    ```
>
>    > <details-title>"push origin"</details-title>
>    > When you `git push`ed, you specified `origin`. Git repositories can know that forks exist in multiple places. When you clone one, it creates a "remote" (a remote repository) which it names `origin`, set to the URL that you used when you cloned. By having multiple remotes, you can manage more complex workflows.

{: .hands_on}

</div>

To check this has worked, you can go to your GitHub account.

> <hands-on-title>Push the changes</hands-on-title>
> 1. Go to your GitHub repository on a web browser
> 2. Change to the "my_new_branch" branch:
>    1. Click on **Branch: main** (left)
>
>       ![Selecting branch on GitHub](../../images/PR_branch_github.png)
>
>    2. Select the branch "my_new_branch"
>
> 4. Check that your name is in the `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` file

![Pushing changes to the fork from the local copy](../../images/PR_schema_04.png "Pushing changes from the local copy to the fork on GitHub")

# Open a pull request

You pushed your changes to GitHub, but currently they are only on your fork. You want to have these changes in the main GitHub repository in order to appear on our [Hall of Fame]({% link hall-of-fame.md %}) online. You can't add or push directly the main GitHub repository, so you need to create what we call a pull request:

![Pull request](../../images/PR_schema_05.png "Pull Requests provide a way to notify project maintainers about the changes you'd like them to consider")

<div class="Desktop" markdown="1">
> <comment-title></comment-title>

{: .hands_on}

Once the pull is open, it will be reviewed. There are two possible outcomes:

1. Your pull request is accepted. Congratulations! Your changes will be merged into the main branch of the original repository. The website will be re-built and you will be in the [Hall of Fame]({% link hall-of-fame.md %})
2. Your pull request needs modifications: the reviewers will ask for some changes, possibly because the automatic tests are failing.

# Make any requested changes

<div class="Desktop" markdown="1">

Three things can happen:

1. A reviewer commits changes to your pull request (they fix something themselves)
2. A reviewer suggests changes to your pull request (they think something will be helpful, but want you to check and decide)
3. A reviewer posts comments, asking you to make some sort of change.

On larger pull requests, you can end up with all three! Here's how to deal this.

## 1: A reviewer commits their own changes to your pull request

These changes currently only exist in your GitHub repository online, not on your local branch. In case you have to make any further changes, it's important you *fetch* those changes onto your local branch. This is how you stay up to date.

> <hands-on-title>Fetch origin</hands-on-title>
> 1. On your GitHub Desktop, select **Fetch origin**
>       ![Fetch origin](../../images/desktop-fetch_origin.png)
>
{: .hands_on}

You can then make further changes locally, keeping your local and online branch synched.

## 2: A reviewer suggests changes

> <hands-on-title>Commit suggested changes</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. On your Pull Request link where you see the suggested changes, commit them by clicking on the "Commit suggestion" button (or engage further, or edit them) on GitHub
>
>       ![Fetch origin](../../images/desktop-commit_suggestion.png)
>
> 2. Now that your branch is updated, you need to **Fetch origin**
>
>       ![Fetch origin](../../images/desktop-fetch_origin.png)
>
{: .hands_on}

You can then make further changes locally, keeping your local and online branch synched (are you noticing a pattern?).

## 3: A reviewer posts comments to be addressed

</div>

For example, one of the reviewers of your pull request may have asked you to add your name after your GitHub username in the `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` file, if you didn't already.

<div class="Desktop" markdown="1">

> <hands-on-title>Make further changes</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Just like when you made your initial branch and edited the file in your text editor, go to GitHub Desktop | **Current Branch** (make sure it is the correct one!) | **Open the repository in your external editor**
>
> 2. Navigate to the `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` file and make any suggested changes
>
> 3. Save the file
>
> 4. Commit the changes to your branch (as before)
>
> 5. Select **Push origin** to push these changes from your local folder to your online GitHub branch (which is linked to your pull request)
>
>       ![Push origin](../../images/desktop-push_origin.png)
>
>    The pull request should be automatically updated
>
> 6. Check that the new changes are added to the pull request on GitHub
>

# Check the automatic tests

When a pull request is opened, some automated tests are automatically launched on [Travis](http://travis-ci.com/) to be sure that the changes do not break the website, the URL are valid, etc.

On the bottom of your pull request, you can see the status of the tests:

- Yellow (with circle)

    ![Running](../../images/PR_test_yellow.png)

    The tests are still running

- Red (with cross)

    ![Failed tests](../../images/PR_test_red.png)

    When it is red, you can investigate why by clicking on **Details**. You will be redirected on [Travis](http://travis-ci.com/) where you can see the logs of the tests. Get in touch with us on [Gitter]({{ site.gitter_url }}) if you need help to understand the issue.

- Green (with tick)

    ![Passed tests](../../images/PR_test_green.png)

    The tests passed. Good job!

    Even it is green, we recommend to check the result of the tests, as some of tests are allowed to fail (to avoid too much noise).




<div class="Command-line" markdown="1">

# Stay up to date

You now want to work on a new tutorial or make some other new changes. However since you get a local copy, some changes have happened to the original GitHub repository. You need then to update your local copy of the repository before changing anything.

# Finishing the pull request

Great! You now know how to make pull request on GitHub, and how to make changes after a review. Reviewers can now approve and merge your pull request, however, there's no point adding you as a contributor if you don't plan to contribute! So you have to make a choice - do you plan to contribute now, later, or never?

{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html disambiguation="whencontribute"  option1="Contribute-now" option2="Contribute-later" option3="Contribute-never" default="Contribute-now"
       text="Your choice impacts how you will continue with your pull request." %}

<div class="Contribute-never" markdown="1">

If you do not intend to contribute to Galaxy, please close the pull request as per below.

<div class="Contribute-now" markdown="1">

Thank you so much for being willing to contribute! The easiest way to start contributing is to look through training materials to find typos, poor figure legends or alt text - basically, a text-based issue that you can correct. If you're feeling bold, you can also look at some of these [ideas for ways to contribute]({% link faqs/gtn/contributors_getting_started.md %}).

1. Find a typo/error
2. Fix it locally, just the way you edited the `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` file above.
3. Commit this change to your branch (the same one with yourself added to the `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` file)
4. Push this change from your local machine to the Github site
5. Check the change is reflected in your Pull Request

The steps are the same as your initial contribution to the `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` file. You will then, as before, engage further with reviewers to finalise your Pull Request, and eventually (if all goes well!) your Pull Request will be approved and merged!

{% icon congratulations %} Congrats, you'll have made your first contribution to the Galaxy Training Network!

# Conclusion


With this tutorial, you have learned some basics `git` commands and principles:

![Summary of the links between GitHub, fork and local repository](../../images/PR_global_schema.png "Summary of the links between GitHub, fork and local repository")

You also learned the GitHub flow and its cycle:

1. Create a new branch in your local copy
2. Commit the changes in that branch
1. Push that branch to your fork on GitHub
1. Submit a pull request from that branch to the main repository
1. Wait for feedbacks and make requested changes
1. Update your local copy
1. Restart the cycle

You can now contribute and help us to improve our tutorials!
