title: "Introduction to Machine learning"
questions:
    - What is machine learning?
    - Why is it useful?
    - What are its different approaches?
objectives:
    - Provide the basics of machine learning and its variants.
    - Learn how to do classification using the training and test data.
    - Learn how to use Galaxy's machine learning tools.
key_points:
    - Machine learning algorithms learn features from data.
    - It is used for multiple tasks such as classification, regression, clustering and so on.
    - Multiple learning tasks can be performed using Galaxy's machine learning tools.
    - For the classification and regression tasks, data is divided into training and test sets.
    - Each sample/record in the training data has a category/class/label.
    - A machine learning algorithm learns features from the training data and do predictions on the test data.
